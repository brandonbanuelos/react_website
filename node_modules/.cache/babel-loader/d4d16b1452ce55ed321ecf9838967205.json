This time the UI was customized using CSS. The link below\n                        contains the 1.5 version of PatrolBot. This means it has the action detection\n                        model and algorithm, but it doesn't have the upgraded UI. This is because\n                        version 2 was still part of the prototype development.\n                    </p>\n                    <button className=\"PatrolBotV1.5\">View Code</button>\n                <h1 className=\"I3DDemo\">I3D Demo</h1>\n                    <p>This demo was created to show of my novel solution to a problem\n                        my group encountered during the development of PatrolBotV3. The issue\n                        was that the action detection model ran on mp4 files rather than lists\n                        or arrays of frames. PatrolBotV3 was the transformation from a locally-ran\n                        application to a web application, so saving and loading mp4 files would have\n                        added too much complication. Instead I decided to find a way to save a series\n                        of frames from the webcam and format them into a way that was readable by the \n                        Slow Fast or Inflated 3D models for action detection. This demo also\n                        shows off the training on this model done by my team. We trained this model\n                        to detect if behavior is aggressive or not. This demo takes\n                        webcam input and stores it during the duration of running time \n                        in the code, and predicts whether or not behavior from the video clip \n                        is agressive or not.\n                    </p>\n                    <button className=\"I3DCode\">View Code</button>\n                <h1 className=\"PatrolBotV3\">PatrolBotV3</h1>\n                    <p>This version of PatrolBot is still in development as of March 2022. \n                        This is the full webapp version of the software. The robot was now \n                        provided to us by a robotics professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, and \n                        the web application controls the frontend and backend. We are using Django with\n                        HTML, CSS, and Javascript, on an elastic beanstalk instace. Video data\n                        is streamed from a Raspberry Pi on the robot to the Django app where both machine\n                        learning models are ran. Commands from the website's frontend are sent to\n                        a separate Raspberry Pi on the robot which takes the commands and interprets them\n                        as ROS code before sending it to the robot. The repository is currently private.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n        </div>\n\n    );\n}\n\nexport default Projects;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
